0. Creating an interface for a student
Copy the following configuration files (provided above) into the task_0 directory: package.json, .eslintrc.js, tsconfig.json, webpack.config.js

Write your code in the main.ts file:

Write an interface named Student that accepts the following elements: firstName(string), lastName(string), age(number), and location(string)
Create two students, and create an array named studentsList containing the two variables
Using Vanilla Javascript, render a table and for each elements in the array, append a new row to the table
Each row should contain the first name of the student and the location
1. Let's build a Teacher interface
Create a directory task_1 and copy these configuration files into this folder: package.json, tsconfig.json, webpack.config.js

firstName(string) and lastName(string). These two attributes should only be modifiable when a Teacher is first initialized
fullTimeEmployee(boolean) this attribute should always be defined
yearsOfExperience(number) this attribute is optional
location(string) this attribute should always be defined
Add the possibility to add any attribute to the Object like contract(boolean) without specifying the name of the attribute

create and export a constant cpp for Cpp Subjects
create and export a constant java for Java Subjects
create and export a constant react for React Subjects
create and export one Teacher object cTeacher with experienceTeachingC = 10
for Cpp subject, log to the console C++, set cTeacher as the teacher, call the two methods getRequirements and getAvailableTeacher and print the strings they return
for Java subject, log to the console Java, set cTeacher as the teacher, call the two methods getRequirements and getAvailableTeacher, and print the strings they return
for React subject, log to the console React, set cTeacher as the teacher, call the two methods getRequirements and getAvailableTeacher, and print the strings they return
11. Brand convention & Nominal typing
Create a directory task_5 and copy these configuration files into the root of task_5: package.json, tsconfig.json, webpack.config.js

Create two interfaces MajorCredits and MinorCredits in task_5/js/main.ts:

Each interface defines a number named credits
Add a brand property to each interface in order to uniquely identify each of them
Create two functions named sumMajorCredits and sumMinorCredits in task_5/js/main.ts:

Each function takes two arguments subject1 and subject2
sumMajorCredits returns MajorCredits value and sumMinorCredits returns MinorCredits value
Each function sums the credits of the two subjects
